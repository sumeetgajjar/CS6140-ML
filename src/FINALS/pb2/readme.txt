This problem is similar to the Bernoulli coins problem 6 of HW 4 (Generative models).

The Bernoulli mixture consists of 3 bernoulli distributions since there are 3 problems.

I use EM algo to fit the given data to the Bernoulli mixture.

The mixture coefficients are the probabilities of selecting the problem.
And the bernoulli co-efficient q_k is the probability of student solving a problem.
