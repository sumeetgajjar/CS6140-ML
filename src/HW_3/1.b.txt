The encoding part of training algorithm tries to perform the dimensionality reduction by encoding the input into fewer number of bits.
This step happens in the encoder component of the neural network.

Similarly the decoding part of the algorithm tries to perform the reverse of dimensionality reduction.
It tries to reconstruct the original input from the encoded form.

So as a whole the network takes the input and output the input.
The idea of encoder and decoder comes into play when after completing the training of the entire network,
we break and group the network into 2 parts.

And hence,
input layer + hidden layer becomes the encoder
hidden layer + output layer becomes the decoder.
